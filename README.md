Hello, World! I created this project to practice and sharpen my frontend skills using JavaScript and React, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind. I'm still learning and becoming a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer has always been a dream of mine.
> Feel free to leave me some feedback on what I can improve on. Thanks for viewing!
